# Welcome to my first repo - Number Guessing game.
Since it's just a mini-project and focused on learning new concepts, I kept it simple.
I am the 'Users first!' guy, so I added a lot of user friendly stuff and error handling too!

## What it does
The Game uses 'random' library to generate random number between set boundaries.
Your goal is to find the random number using your logic, since the program gives you hints e.g. 'Too high' or 'Too low'

## How to play
It's simple, after a short welcoming message you have to set minimum and maximum numbers, these are boundaries which will be used to determine range of numbers where
random number can be generated.
After setting the boundaries, the real game starts. Write a number and press Enter, adjust accordingly and find the hidden number!
Note: In the end you'll get a number of total attempts, try to keep it lower than 10(for a bit of challenge...)
